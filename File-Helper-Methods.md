##  <a name="files"> File Manipulation Methods for Tests
Use these methods in a test or setup/teardown method to make file related testing easier.  These all exist on the Gut object so they must be prefixed with `gut`
* `gut.file_touch(path)` create an empty file if it doesn't exist.
* `gut.file_delete(path)` delete a file
* `gut.is_file_empty(path)` checks if a file is empty
* `gut.directory_delete_files` deletes all files in a directory.  does not delete subdirectories or any files in them.
