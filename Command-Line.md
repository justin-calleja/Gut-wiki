# TODO .gutconfig.json

Also supplied in this repo is the `gut_cmdln.gd` script that can be run from the command line so that you don't have to create a scene to run your tests.  One of the main reasons to use this approach instead of going through the editor is that you get to see error messages generated by Godot in the context of your running tests.  You also see any `print` statements you put in  your code in the context of all the Gut generated output.  It's a bit quicker to get started and is a bit cooler if I do say so.  The biggest downside is that debugging your code/tests is a little more difficult since you won't be able to interact with the editor when something blows up.

From the command line, at the root of your project, use the following command to run the script.  Use the options below to run tests.
	`godot -d -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd`

The `-d` option tells Godot to run in debug mode which is helpful.  The `-s` option tells Godot to run a script.

### Options
_Output from the command line help (-gh)_
```
---------------------------------------------------------                               
This is the command line interface for the unit testing tool Gut.  With this
interface you can run one or more test scripts from the command line.  In order
for the Gut options to not clash with any other Godot options, each option
starts with a "g".  Also, any option that requires a value will take the form of
"-g<name>=<value>".  There cannot be any spaces between the option, the "=", or
inside a specified value or Godot will think you are trying to run a scene.       

Options

  -gtest          Comma delimited list of tests to run
  -gdir           Comma delimited list of directories to add tests from.
  -gprefix        Prefix used to find tests when specifying -gdir.  Default
                  "test_"
  -gsuffix        Suffix used to find tests when specifying -gdir.  Default
                  ".gd"
  -gexit          Exit after running tests.  If not specified you have to
                  manually close the window.
  -glog           Log level.  Default 1
  -gignore_pause  Ignores any calls to gut.pause_before_teardown.
  -gselect        Select a script to run initially.  The first script that was
                  loaded using -gtest or -gdir that contains the specified
                  string will be executed.  You may run others by interacting
                  with the GUI.
  -gutloc         Full path (including name) of the gut script.  Default
                  res://addons/gut/gut.gd
  -gh             Print this help
---------------------------------------------------------   
```

### Examples

Run godot in debug mode (-d), run a test script (-gtest), set log level to lowest (-glog), exit when done (-gexit)

`godot -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -d -gtest=res://test/unit/sample_tests.gd -glog=1 -gexit`

Load all test scripts that begin with 'me_' and end in '.res' and run me_only_only_me.res (given that the directory contains the following scripts:  me_and_only_me.res, me_only.res, me_one.res, me_two.res).  I don't specify the -gexit on this one since I might want to run all the scripts using the GUI after I run this one script.

`godot -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -d -gdir=res://test/unit -gprefix=me_ -gsuffix=.res -gselect=only_me`

### Alias
Make your life easier by creating an alias that includes your most frequent options.  Here's the one I use in bash:

`alias gut='godot -d -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://test/unit,res://test/integration -gexit -gignore_pause'`

This alias loads up all the scripts I want from my testing directories and sets some other flags.  With this, if I want to run 'test_one.gd', I just enter `gut -gselect=test_one.gd`.

### Common Errors
I really only know of one so far, but if you get a space in your command somewhere, you might see something like this:
```
ERROR:  No loader found for resource: res://samples3
At:  core\io\resource_loader.cpp:209
ERROR:  Failed loading scene: res://samples3
At:  main\main.cpp:1260
```
I got this one when I accidentally put a space instead of an "=" after -gselect.
