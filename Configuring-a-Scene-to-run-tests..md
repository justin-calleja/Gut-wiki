These methods would be used inside the scene you created at `res://test/tests.tcn`.  These methods can be called against the Gut node you created.  Most of these are not necessary anymore since you can configure Gut in the editor but they are here if you want to use them.  Simply put `get_node('Gut').` in front of any of them.  

<i>__**__ indicates the option can be set via the editor</i>
* `add_script(script, select_this_one=false)` add a script to be tetsted with test_scripts
* __**__`add_directory(path, prefix='test_', suffix='.gd')` add a directory of test scripts that start with prefix and end with suffix.  Subdirectories not included.  This method is useful if you have more than the 6 directories the editor allows you to configure.  You can use this to add others.
* __**__`test_scripts()` run all scripts added with add_script or add_directory.  If you leave this out of your script then you can select which script will run, but you must press the "run" button to start the tests.
* `test_script(script)` runs a single script immediately.
* __**__`select_script(script_name)` sets a script added with `add_script` or `add_directory` to be initially selected.  This allows you to run one script instead of all the scripts.  This will select the first script it finds that contains the specified string.
* `get_test_count()` return the number of tests run
* `get_assert_count()` return the number of assertions that were made
* `get_pass_count()` return the number of tests that passed
* `get_fail_count()` return the number of tests that failed
* `get_pending_count()` return the number of tests that were pending
* __**__`get/set_should_print_to_console(should)` accessors for printing to console
* `get_result_text()` returns all the text contained in the GUI
* `clear_text()` clears the text in the GUI
* `set_ignore_pause_before_teardown(should_ignore)` causes GUI to disregard any calls to pause_before_teardown.  This is useful when you want to run in a batch mode.
* __**__`set_yield_between_tests(should)` will pause briefly between every 5 tests so that you can see progress in the GUI.  If this is left out, it  can seem like the program has hung when running longer test sets.
* __**__`get/set_log_level(level)` see section on log level for list of values.
* __**__`disable_strict_datatype_checks(true)` disables strict datatype checks.  See section on "Strict type checking" before disabling.
