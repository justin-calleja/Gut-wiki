##  <a name="watch"> Watching tests as they execute
When running longer tests it can appear as though the program or Gut has hung.  To address this and see the tests as they execute, a short yield was added between tests.  To enable this feature call `set_yield_between_tests(true)` before running your tests or use the "Yield Between Tests" in the Editor.
