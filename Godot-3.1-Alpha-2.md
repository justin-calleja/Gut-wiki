I've created a [3.1 branch](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/tree/godot_3_1) that will be kept inline with master.  When I'm confident that 3.1 is solid then I'll combine master and 3.1.  I'll list any existing workarounds or major problems here, as well as in the Issues.

## Updated with version 6.1.1 changes.

If you find anything new or have any input, make/comment on an issue.

## Should be alright, probably
* right now the stubbing is not working but everything else appears to be in order.

## Big deals
* none yet

## Small deals
* none yet

## Not quite a big deal but for sure not a small one
* none yet
