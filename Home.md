# Gut 6.2.0
GUT (Godot Unit Test) is a utility for writing tests for your Godot Engine game.  It allows you to write tests for your gdscript in gdscript.

### Godot 3.0 Compatible.
Version 6.0.0 is Godot 3.0 compatible.  These changes are not compatible with any of the 2.x versions of Godot.  The godot_2x branch has been created to hold the old version of Gut that works with Godot 2.x.  Barring any severe issues, there will not be any more development for Godot 2.x.

# License
Gut is provided under the MIT license.  [The license is distributed with Gut so it is in the `addons/gut` folder](addons/gut/LICENSE.md).  I also didn't want the Gut license to accidentally be copied into another project's root directory when installed through the Godot Asset Library.
